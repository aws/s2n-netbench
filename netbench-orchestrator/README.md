# Netbench Orchestrator

Automate netbench runs in the cloud.

## Goals
Often developers of transport protocols are interested in gathering performance data for the protocol
they are developing. Netbench is a tool which can be used to measure this performance data.
However, its often necessary to run Netbench scenarios in the cloud so that the results better match
production systems. The goal of this project is to automate Netbench runs in the cloud.
